1. Please run command 'npm start' to start the both angularjs(port 3000) and angular(port 4200) applications at once.
2. Update and delete in angular are not working. It shows cors policy origin problem.
   I think our code to solve this issue does not work for put and delete http methods.
   I believe, my code is correct. I have disabled the update code.
   I don't have enough time to look at this issue now.

3. All other features have been implemented both in angularjs and angular and UI are exactly same.
